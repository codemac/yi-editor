BUILDING AND INSTALLING

You can get the latest yi source from its darcs repository:

        darcs get http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~dons/yi

You will need GHC 6 (The Glorious/Glasgow Haskell Compilation System)
and GNU make to compile yi. On OpenBSD you'll need ghc-6.2.2 or greater, 
which contains a patch for the System.Posix.User library.

You also need a recent snapshot version of hs-plugins, the Haskell
dynamic loader library. You can get this from:

        http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~dons/hs-plugins/

You currently need to use a cvs snapshot of hs-plugins, from Oct 26 2004 or 
later. Make sure you "make", "make install" and "make register" the library.

If you are working from the darcs repository you'll need autoconf and
automake installed for generating the configure files.

Once you have ensured that you have these programs and libraries
installed:

 1. autoreconf
    ./configure --prefix=/my/dir

 2. Run 'make'         ('gmake' on some systems)

 3. Run 'make install' to install it, and then use 'yi'
        OR
    Just use './yi-inplace' directly in the build tree (without
    having to install) 

Hint: 'make show-install' will show you which directories yi wants
to install into. These are editable in mk/config.mk

Useful targets:
        make                    -- build the lot
        make boot               -- regen the dependencies
        make all                -- compile the .hs source
        make install            -- install into $(PREFIX)
        make show-install       -- print install paths
        make clean              -- remove most rebuildable stuff
        make distclean          -- remove anything that can be regenerated
        make docs               -- build all the docs
        make html               -- build the haddock docs

        make way=p              -- build a profiling version of yi
        make way=static         -- build a static-only version of yi

CONFIGURATION

All configuration (bindings, colours) is done at either build time by
editing the yi src, or at runtime by editing ~/.yi/Config.hs.  Example
config files are in examples/.

PORTABILITY

Yi is developed on OpenBSD and Debian Linux. It relies on the hs-plugins
library, which has been ported to most platforms, but currently not
Windows -- however yi-static should probably work on Windows. Yi
requires GHC 6 with a working GHCi implementation. A porting checklist:

        * you have GNU make
        * you have >= GHC 6.2.1         (>= 6.3-20040929 on OpenBSD)
        * you have a working GHCi
        * you have hs-plugins >= 2004/10/14
