------------------------------------------------------------------------

QUICK START

To build the static editor (enough for most people):

    $ ./configure --prefix=/usr/local
    $ make way=static
    $ ./yi-static README

To build the whole thing, including the dynamic components:

    Dependencies:
        * you need ghc 6.4, and
        * you need to install hs-plugins 0.9.10

    $ ./configure --prefix=/usr/local
    $ make
    $ ./yi-inplace README  or  ./yi-static README

Additionally,

 * Users of the darcs repo will require autoreconf, which is part of the
   automake suite of tools.  And you may also need to 'chmod a+x configure', 
   or darcs get --set-scripts-executable.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

BUILDING AND INSTALLING

You can get the latest Yi source from its darcs repository:

        darcs get http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~dons/yi

You will need GHC 6 (The Glorious/Glasgow Haskell Compilation System)
and GNU make to compile yi. 

To build an extensible editor, you need hs-plugins 0.9.10, which in turn
depends on HSX, which requires ghc 6.4.

You can get hs-plugins from:

        http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~dons/hs-plugins/

Getting the most recent snapshot will work. Make sure you "make", "make
install" and "make register" the hs-plugins library. 

Once you have ensured that you have these programs and libraries
installed:

 1. ./configure --prefix=/my/dir

 2. make         	('gmake' on some systems)

You can then use ./yi-static or ./yi-inplace.

And if you wish to install Yi:

 3. make install

Hint: 'make show-install' will show you which directories yi wants
to install into. These are editable in mk/config.mk

Useful targets:
        make                    -- build the lot
        make boot               -- regen the dependencies
        make build              -- compile the .hs source
        make all                -- compile the .hs source and docs
        make install            -- install into $(PREFIX)
        make show-install       -- print install paths
        make check              -- run the testsuite
        make clean              -- remove most rebuildable stuff
        make distclean          -- remove anything that can be regenerated
        make clean FAST=1       -- remove anything, fast!
        make distclean FAST=1   -- remove anything, fast!
        make docs               -- build all the docs
        make html               -- build the haddock docs

        make way=p              -- build a profiling version of yi
        make way=static         -- build a static-only version of yi

CONFIGURATION

All configuration (bindings, colours) is done at either build time by
editing the yi src, or at runtime by editing ~/.yi/Config.hs.  Example
config files are in examples/.

PORTABILITY

Yi is developed on OpenBSD, FreeBSD and Debian Linux. Dynamic
configuration relies on the hs-plugins library, which has been ported to
most platforms, including Windows. Dynamic Yi requires GHC 6 with a
working GHCi implementation, static Yi should work with GHC 6.2 and
later. 

A porting checklist:

        * you have GNU make
        * you have a recent autoconf and automake
        * you have GHC >= 6.2.1         (>= 6.2.2 on OpenBSD)
        * you have a working GHCi
        * you have hs-plugins >= 0.9.10
        * you have haddock installed (for the documentation)

The static version of yi has no hs-plugins support, and is thus more
portable (you only need GHC 6.0, too). However, it is not configurable
at runtime. To build this, you'll just need to be on a machine with ghc
installed.
