------------------------------------------------------------------------



DEPENDENCIES

* ghc 6.8.2 or above

* many packages shipped with GHC (filepath, ...)
  see the cabal file for complete list.

* Alex (the haskell lexer generator) 
	http://www.haskell.org/alex/

* for vty frontend
  * latest darcs repo version. 
        http://members.cox.net/stefanor/vty

* for gtk frontend, gtk2hs 0.9.12.
        http://haskell.org/gtk2hs/download/

* for cocoa frontend
  * latest SVN repo version of HOC:
        # First you need to install libffi (unless you have leopard)
        svn co http://hoc.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/libffi
        cd libffi/src
        ../configure --prefix=/usr/local CFLAGS=-DMACOSX
        make
        sudo make install
        
        # Then you install the latest hoc version
        svn co http://hoc.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/hoc
        cd hoc
        runhaskell Setup configure --prefix=/usr/local
        runhaskell Setup build
        sudo runhaskell Setup install
        cd Bindings
        sudo bash make-bindings-macos.sh --prefix=/usr/local


QUICK START:

* configure, compile and install yi as you would do for any other Cabal package
  NOTE: if you get 

    Setup.hs: Package yi-0.3 can't be built on this system.

  it means that you have no UI package available. See DEPENDENCIES.

* copy examples/YiConfig.hs to ~/.yi/ and taylor to your needs

* run yi

  $(install-prefix)/yi

run

  yi --help

for a list of options.

QUICK START with cabal-make:

* To use the Makefile you need a working config.mk file you can
  obtain this in one of two ways:
  1 - copy config.sample to config.mk and edit as required
  2 - runhaskell MkConfig.hs --help
      this will show you the options available re-run with the
      appropriate options, you probably at least want:
      runhaskells MkConfig.hs --prefix <path-to-prefix> --user username
      This will produce a config.test copy this across to config.mk

* make all
  will configure, build, document and install.

HACKER'S GUIDE: 

You can run Yi "in place" by running:

make run-inplace

You can then try your changes dynamically by running the "reconfigE" command. (M-x
reconfigE in emacs mode)


CONFIGURATION

All configuration (bindings, colours) is done with ~/.yi/YiConfig.hs
See examples directory for files that you can use as ~/.yi/YiConfig.hs.
Drop the --as=... when you have defined your YiConfig.hs



PORTABILITY

Yi is developed on Linux.
FreeBSD and OpenBSD: should be ok.
OS X: Vty Ok, Gtk should work; you can also help us debug the Cocoa frontend.
MS Windows: you can try Gtk frontend.


A porting checklist:
        * you have a working GHCi
        * you have either gtk or vty support
