BUILDING AND INSTALLING

You will need GHC 6 (The Glorious/Glasgow Haskell Compilation System)
and GNU make to compile hemacs. 

You also need a recent snapshot version of hs-plugins, the Haskell
dynamic loader library. You can get this from:
        http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~dons/hs-plugins/
The "heatwave" snapshot is suitable.

Once you have ensured that you have these programs and libraries installed,

 1. Edit mk/config.mk to change some settings for your system (usually in
    the case it has broken wide character support).

 2. Run 'make'         ('gmake' on some systems)

 3. Run 'make install' to install it
        OR
    Just use 'hemacs-inplace' in the build tree.
    'make show-install' will show the bindir and libdir vars


CONFIGURATION

All configuration (bindings, colours) is done at either build time by
editing ConfigAPI.hs, or at runtime by editing ~/.hemacs/Config.hs.
Example config files are in plugins/
