BUILDING AND INSTALLING

You can get the latest yi source from its darcs repository:

        darcs get http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~dons/yi

You will need GHC 6 (The Glorious/Glasgow Haskell Compilation System)
and GNU make to compile yi. On OpenBSD you'll need ghc-6.3-20040929, 
or greater, which contains a patch for the System.Posix.User library.

You also need a recent snapshot version of hs-plugins, the Haskell
dynamic loader library. You can get this from:
        http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~dons/hs-plugins/
The `heatwave' snapshot is suitable (released 20041014). Make sure you
"make", "make install" and "make register" the library.

Once you have ensured that you have these programs and libraries
installed:

 1. Edit mk/config.mk to change any settings for your system (usually
    in the case it has broken wide character support).

 2. Run 'make'         ('gmake' on some systems)

 3. Run 'make install' to install it, and then use 'yi'
        OR
    Just use './yi-inplace' directly in the build tree (without
    having to install) 

Hint: 'make show-install' will show you which directories yi wants
to install into. These are editable in mk/config.mk

Useful targets:
        make                    -- build the lot
        make boot               -- regen the dependencies
        make all                -- compile the .hs source
        make install            -- install into $(PREFIX)
        make clean              -- remove most rebuildable stuff
        make distclean          -- remove anything that can be regenerated
        make docs               -- build all the docs
        make html               -- build the haddock docs

CONFIGURATION

All configuration (bindings, colours) is done at either build time by
editing Yi/ConfigAPI.hs, or at runtime by editing
~/.yi/Config.hs.  Example config files are in plugins/

PORTABILITY

Yi is developed on OpenBSD and Debian Linux. It relies on the
hs-plugins library, which has been ported to most platforms, but
currently not Windows. Yi requires GHC 6 with a working GHCi
implementation. A porting checklist:

        * you have GNU make
        * you have >= GHC 6.2.1         (>= 6.3-20040929 on OpenBSD)
        * you have a working GHCi
        * you have hs-plugins >= 2004/10/14
