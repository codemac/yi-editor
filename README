BUILDING AND INSTALLING

You will need GHC 6 (The Glorious/Glasgow Haskell Compilation System)
and GNU make to compile hemacs. 

You also need a recent snapshot version of hs-plugins, the Haskell
dynamic loader library. You can get this from:
        http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~dons/hs-plugins/

Once you have ensured that you have these programs and libraries installed,

 1. Edit system.mk to change some settings for your system (usually in
   the case it has broken wide character support).

 2. Run 'make' ('gmake' on some systems) to build hemacs.

 3. Run 'make install' to install it.


CONFIGURATION

All configuration (bindings, colours) is done at either build time by
editing Config.hs, or at runtime by editing ~/.hemacs/Config.hs


CREDITS
