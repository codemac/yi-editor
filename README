DEPENDENCIES

* filepath 1.0, or lastest darcs repo version.
        http://darcs.haskell.org/packages/filepath/

* Alex (the haskell lexer generator) 
	http://www.haskell.org/alex/

* for vty frontend
  * vty 3.0.0, or latest darcs repo version. 
        http://members.cox.net/stefanor/vty

* for gtk frontend, gtk2hs 0.9.12.
        http://haskell.org/gtk2hs/download/

see also yi.cabal file for other dependencies.


QUICK START:

* compile yi as you would do for any other Cabal package

* copy examples/YiConfig.hs to ~/.yi/ and taylor to your needs

* run yi

$(install-prefix)/yi --as=vim 
$(install-prefix)/yi --as=emacs 
...

run

yi --help

for a list of options.

QUICK START with cabal-make:

* To use the Makefile you need a working config.mk file you can
  obtain this in one of two ways:
  1 - copy config.sample to config.mk and edit as required
  2 - runhaskell MkConfig.hs --help
      this will show you the options available re-run with the
      appropriate options, you probably at least want:
      runhaskells MkConfig.hs --prefix <path-to-prefix> --user username
      This will produce a config.test copy this across to config.mk

* make all
  will configure, build, document and install.

HACKER'S GUIDE: 

You can run Yi "in place" by running:

dist/build/yi/yi -B.


You can then try your changes by running the "reconfigE" command. (M-x
reconfigE in emacs mode)



CONFIGURATION

All configuration (bindings, colours) is done with ~/.yi/YiConfig.hs
See examples directory for files that you can use as ~/.yi/YiConfig.hs.
Drop the --as=... when you have defined your YiConfig.hs



PORTABILITY

Yi is developed on Linux, and should be easily ported to FreeBSD and
OpenBSD. Running Gtk fronted to MS Windows should be possible.

A porting checklist:
        * you have GNU make
        * you have a working GHCi
        * you have either gtk or vty support
        * you have haddock installed (for the documentation)
