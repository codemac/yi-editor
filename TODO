Design plan:
        - get rid of MBox and Editor stuff
        - design a buffer
        - think about abstractable actions/keybindings
        - clean up code
        - remove posix dependency

Build system:
        - write a configure script
        - check how to install it from a port script
        - think about how to do a testsuite
        - get profiling working

Docs:
        - what format docs/hemacs.tex?
        - get rid of haddock warnings
