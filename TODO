Design plan:
        - ui type class
        - clean up ncurses code    
        - how a user can override a single binding of a default map
 
Build system:
        - write a configure script
        - check how to install it from a port script
        - think about how to do a testsuite, unit testing
        - store cpp options in a file, instead of on the command line
