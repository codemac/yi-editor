Design plan:
        - get rid of MBox and Editor stuff
        - store state in a global var
        - design a buffer
        - think about abstractable actions/keybindings
        - clean up code
        - remove posix dependency

Dynamic stuff:
        - "rebinding" global_vars by writing fields in global settings, using
          values dynamically compiled.
                :set some_global_var = map reverse
          similar effects by reloading Config.hs
        - scripting: 
                :map toUpper buffer
          by compiling, and applying to global var.

Build system:
        - write a configure script
        - check how to install it from a port script
        - think about how to do a testsuite
        - get profiling working
        - store cpp options in a file, instead of on the command line

Docs:
        - what format docs/hemacs.tex?
        - get rid of haddock warnings
