Design plan:
        - ui type class
        - clean up ncurses code    
        - replace global var in editor state with a state monad
 
Build system:
        - check how to install it from a port script
        - think about how to do a testsuite, unit testing
        - break out curses in to a separate dir, and the same for other ui's
        - add test for sigwinch

v0.1:
        - line wrapping
        - maybe: syn hl (needs parser, in bg thread)

other stuff:
        - bind keymap lexers to windows
        - :eval, :type, .. etc. ghci stuff
        - make the cmd line a buffer.
        - start drawing buffer before it is all loaded.
        - either generalise registers, or make them entirely keymap-local
