Design plan:
        - ui type class
        - clean up ncurses code    
 
Build system:
        - check how to install it from a port script
        - think about how to do a testsuite, unit testing

        - ncurses should be a plugin

v0.1:
        - syn hl (needs parser, in bg thread)
        - start drawing buffer before it is all loaded.
        - undo/redo in vi mode
        - build on mac os x
        - colours
        - bind keymap lexers to windows
        - :eval, :type, .. etc. ghci stuff
