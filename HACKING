Yi Source Tree Roadmap
======================

Unknown
-------

These need to be documented:

    HConf.hs

Documentation
-------------

    README
    LICENSE
    AUTHORS
    
If you run `cabal haddock` the directory `docs` will contain the
haddock documentation.

    $ make tags

will use `hasktags` to generate a CTAGS file, which most editors can
use to navigate to the definition of identifiers.


Build System
------------

    Setup.hs
    Makefile
    config.sample / config.mk

Using the makefile is just a convenience wrapper around the cabal
build framework.  `config.mk` is not version controlled as it contains
local settings.  `config.sample` can be used as an example to get
started.

    MkConfig.hs

This can be used to generate a `config.mk` file, instead of copying
`config.sample`.


Running
-------

    Main.hs
    HackerMain.hs

These are the main files for normal mode and for hacker mode,
respectively.
