-- Alternative Word Completion

{-
  'completeWordB' is an alternative to 'wordCompleteB'.
  Currently the main reason for this extra function is that the
  aforementioned is rather buggy, two problems I currently have with
  it is that it occasionally remembers the previous word it was completing
  before and completes that rather than the current one. More seriously
  it occasionally crashes yi by going into an infinite loop.

  In the longer term assuming that 'Yi.CharMove.wordCompleteB' is fixed
  (which I would love) then 'completeWordB' offers a slightly different
  interface. The user completes the word using the mini-buffer in the
  same way a user completes a buffer or file name when switching buffers
  or opening a file. This means that it never guesses and completes
  only as much as it can without guessing.

  I think there is room for both approaches. The 'wordCompleteB' approach
  which just guesses the completion from a list of possible completion
  and then re-hitting the key-binding will cause it to guess again.
  I think this is very nice for things such as completing a word within
  a TeX-buffer. However using the mini-buffer might be nicer when we allow
  syntax knowledge to allow completion for example we may complete from
  a Hoogle database.

completeWordB :: EditorM ()
completeWordB = veryQuickCompleteWord


{-
  This is a very quick and dirty way to complete the current word.
  It works in a similar way to the completion of words in the mini-buffer
  it uses the message buffer to give simple feedback such as,
  "Matches:" and "Complete, but not unique:"

  It is by no means perfect but it's also not bad, pretty usable.
-}
veryQuickCompleteWord :: EditorM ()
veryQuickCompleteWord =
  do (curWord, curWords) <- withBuffer0 wordsAndCurrentWord
     let condition :: String -> Bool
         condition x   = (isPrefixOf curWord x) && (x /= curWord)

     preText             <- completeInList curWord condition curWords
     if curWord == ""
        then printMsg "No word to complete"
        else withBuffer0 $ insertN $ drop (length curWord) preText

wordsAndCurrentWord :: BufferM (String, [ String ])
wordsAndCurrentWord =
  do curSize          <- sizeB
     curText          <- readRegionB $ mkRegion 0 curSize
     curWord          <- readRegionB =<< regionOfPartB Word Backward
     let curWords     = words curText
     return (curWord, curWords)

{-
  Finally obviously we wish to have a much more sophisticated completeword.
  One which spawns a mini-buffer and allows searching in Hoogle databases
  or in other files etc.
