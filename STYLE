DISCLAIMER:

We don't need endless discussions, or worse a flamewar, regarding
coding guidelines, but we want (some) consistency in the
codebase. Hence, I come up with these guidelines that I define
dictatorially. If you disagree with something here, you can comment in
private e-mail but it's very likely that your comment will be ignored.

For obvious reasons, don't change this file.

STYLE GUIDELINES:

* Please stick to the following guidelines when you write new code.

* Don't change code for purely stylistic reasons!

* Haddock.

Comment all top-level functions
Use no line with just '--' before or after the comment text.
Don't put a blank line between the haddock comment and the commented entity.

Example

    -- | Description, description, description
    -- ... continued on other line.
    f :: Type
    f = definition



* Parentheses, brackets, etc.

Space outside; no space inside.

Example

x :: [Int]
x = (a + 1) * 2


* Case

Use camelCase

example:
