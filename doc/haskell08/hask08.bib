	abstract = {As software becomes more and more complex, it is
                  more and more important to structure it
                  well. Well-structured software is easy to write,
                  easy to debug, and provides a collection of modules
                  that can be re-used to reduce future programming
                  costs. Conventional languages place conceptual
                  limits on the way problems can be
                  modularised. Functional languages push those limits
                  back. In this paper we show that two features of
                  functional languages in particular, higher-order
                  functions and lazy...},
