I gave a Yi demo at the Haskell Symposium, and the
[video](http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=4183423992181607417) (recorded
"guerrilla style") is available! (It should also appear on the ACM Digital Library
too, hopefully in better quality, but don't hold your breath.)

The first part demonstrates the Haskell support capabilities, while the second one
shows how Yi can be configured and extended.

The demo abstract can be found [here](http://code.haskell.org/yi/doc/hask08.pdf).
