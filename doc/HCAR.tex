Yi is an editor written in Haskell and extensible in Haskell. We leverage the
expressiveness of Haskell to provide an editor which is powerful and easy to
extend.

Defining characteristics:
\begin{itemize}
\item A purely functional buffer representation;
\item Powerful EDSLs to describe editor actions and keybindings;
\item Syntax-highlighters as Alex files;
\item XMonad-style static/dynamic configuration;
\item UIs written as plugins.
\end{itemize}

We are currently working on making the Gtk front-end fully usable and improving
the syntax highlighters. A lot of work is also put into making the transition
from emacs or vim smoother.

Features:
\begin{itemize}
\item Special support for Haskell: layout-aware edition, paren-matching, beautification of lambdas and arrows, GHCi interface, Cabal build interface, \dots
\item unix console UI;
\item Support for Linux and MacOS platforms;
\item Syntax highlighting for many mainstream languages beside Haskell;
\end{itemize}
